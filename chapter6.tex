\chapter{Resources}
\label{chapter6}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent An incredible amount of resources has been used during this semester in order to understand reinforcement learning, LSTMs, convolutional neural networks and all the other material that has been presented in this report. \\
I would like to post here some courses, blogs, papers useful for this journey.
