# Introduction to reinforcement learning and openAI Gym environments

## Preface

This repo ~~is~~ was a clone of the original [universe-starter-agent](https://github.com/openai/universe-starter-agent) by [openai](https://openai.com/). It has been cloned as a starting point for the Semester Project "Learning to Play Atari Pong with TensorFlow on OpenAI Universe" for the Spring 2017 Semester in [Eurecom](http://www.eurecom.fr/en/) being developed by [Daniele Reda](http://www.github.com/rdednl) with professor [Pietro Michiardi](https://github.com/michiard) as supervisor.

A strange turn of events brought me to concentrate myself on the theory and the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, reading introductory papers and books.

Currently, the repo hosts the final report of the semester project which came up to be an introduction to reinforcement learning. I'm sharing this file for anyone who wants to enter this field.
